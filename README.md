# Travel Itinerary Builder

A program that generates a personalized travel itinerary for a trip.

What I Learned
- Working with `let` and `const` variables
- String concatenation with the `+` operator
- Using `console.log()` to display output

# How to Run
1. Open `itinerary.js` in your browser console
2. View the generated travel itinerary
